                <p>I was raised in an orphanage since I was a small child. I did not have any kind of support after I had to leave the orphanage according to the rules. At that point of time , Team Yuvaan extended a helping hand to me . They took up my responsibility for further skill education. I have since then, again begun to dream about change in my life.</p>

                <p>I completed my Diploma from Womenâ€™s Government Polytechnic, Latur with the help of my teachers. I was apprehensive whether I would be able to go on to procure a degree because of my critical family situation. The only option that I could see available to me was to take up a job to earn my living. At that point of time Team Yuvaan extended a helping hand to me for further education. I just have completed my <b>B.E degree in Computer Engineering </b>with first class and distinction. I wish to be an active member of Yuvaan and sponsor the education of a needy student in the future.</p>
